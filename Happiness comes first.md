# Introduction
Let's assume I am a hunter gatherer. The best moment that I would have to hunt and gather is when I'm at my best physical performance, so I slept well, I'm hydrated, and well nourished. That's obvious.

Why it is obvious that to get more food, it's better to have eaten well, but not so much about happiness? Why do I think I need to be harsh in my self-critics, my goals, to become happy? 
It's like a principle's paradox: I want to attain certain goals and be happy about achieving them. So I can't be happy until I get there, otherwise I would be against my principles, because I would make it harder to achieve my goals because I wouldn't feel the urge to feel happy anymore, so it's against my principles to be happy before I attain my goals.
Also, according to my principles, I should always look for improving myself, so by definition, I will never attain my goals and this is right.
So what the fuck, I will never be happy?
