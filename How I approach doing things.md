# The importance of cycling through different types of activities
## Introduction
As with many other processes in the human body, my brain works better when I cycle between different kinds of activities.
It's like a feeling that I'm using an entirely different brain function, the brain is designed to cycle through different states.
A multidisciplinary pursuit is frequently not vanity, it's a necessity

## The problem with things with too much in common
Seeing too much the patterns that connects different pursuits can hinder my ability to rotate between different activities.
This happens, for example, when I'm thinking about motivation, as it can become a "study of everything" very fast. One of the perspectives that would cause this is the following:
	As motivation is necessary for all pursuits, all pursuits are the same though the eyes of motivation: one thing more to expend it's resources. It's like everything drains from the same tank, so cycling though different types of activities doesn't make any difference, as I'm always doing the same thing: draining from the motivation tank.
If I'm studying everything, I can't cycle between anything, because I will always be doing the same thing.

So, while seeing the pattern that connects things can at the same time widen and deepen my views of many subjects, in this specific scenario it's better to actually focus on how different things feel when doing them.

### The problem with big to-do lists
Like said above, the problem of seeing things too much connect can bring a sense of monotony and hinder all benefits of cycling through different types of activity. This can happen with motivation and productivity, as everything can be seem through it's lenses.
It can also happen with to-do lists: if everything that I do in my life can be put in to do lists, it eventually feels that life is only a forever to-do list.
This is a critic about systems like Getting Things Done, by David Allen, as it incentivizes exactly this. However there are many other benefits, as it will be discussed later.

>[!quote] If I am always cycling through activities, I'm never in a cycle, as to always be in a cycle is to never be in something different.

## When studying
- Learning a new language, especially when it involves looking around the environment where I am, can be a good activity to cycle through while I'm solving math questions.
- Looking far objects/sceneries

## Dosing novelty
For this technique to be effective, when choosing which activities I'm going to cycle through, one of the main factors I have to consider is the amount of novelty there will be in the next activity of the cycle.
The main idea of cycling through unalike pursuits is to let one area of my mind to relax by using another. However, if there's too much that I have never seen before in the other task, the brain will not be able to rest.
So, for example, if I'm going to cycle between solving math questions and playing chess: it's not just start a match of chess, as it will be as much novelty as playing chess itself can have. What I have to do is to deliberately and in hindsight to limit the amount of novelty I will see. In this specific example, it could be to review a specific group of end games setups.
I have to set things in a way that the most part of what I see is repeated, but sometimes with a touch of novelty. Before starting the next activity of the cycle, I should have a good idea of what I'm going to find before doing it.
Novelty should be the spice, not the meal itself.

So, in summary, the activities that I'm cycling through should be:
- Different enough from one another so I feel I'm using an entirely different set of skills
- With just a touch of novelty so the brain doesn't get overwhelmed or distracted
### A comment about social media
When talking about attention span and brain rot, the main harm of social media isn't caused primarily by the fastest paced content, but because it's only novelty. The working of these platforms (i.g. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) is based on the lack of content overlap: everything is always new, I have practically no idea of what I will see in the next scroll.

## Suggestions of radically different types of skillsets
- Ear trainers (like the app "Complete Ear Trainer")
- Color theory
- Estimating distances from where I am (or another units, like mass)
- Drawing maps from memory
- Learning a new language
- Board games (like chess)
- Speed running in games
- Solving mathematical questions (and the equivalent from other subjects)

# Things that may seem obvious, but must be explicitly said and remember
- Different actions require different ways of doing
- What works at one time, may not work at other



# The importance of repertoires of mind traps
This comes from a very basic idea of naming things. When I can name a pattern, being a type of animal or an idea, I can connect it more easily across time. Now, when I identify this pattern, I know that it is an old thing that I already encountered before

## Rhetoric over-optimization
It's the excessive search and tweaking of which words will have the most effect in what I'm trying to achieve. Generally, motivation.
For example, I overthink the description of what I'm going to do, so I can get more motivation out of the command

Thinking about how tiny changes in the past could have caused a different present (don't think about the future, as this could cause anxiety, but about a different version of today)



**Task Switching and Executive Control:**  
Cognitive psychology also examines the costs and benefits of switching between tasks. While switching can sometimes introduce “switching costs” (the time and effort needed to reorient your focus), rotating between tasks that use different types of cognitive resources can actually help manage fatigue.

# Brain analogies that mislead
- The brain is not a muscle
- The brain is not a computer
- The brain doesn't work like a LLM
- Develop these ideas and show the harms that they do when talking about doing things
- There is a good development of these ideas in the book "The untethered soul the journey beyond yourself"
- The brain is not a maximizing function



# Other topics to discuss
- An action doesn't exist in isolation, it can only be interpreted in the context of other actions.
- Alternate states of consciousness
	- Sleep
	- Coffee
	- Fasting
	- 
- Rest
	- Theory of necessity of resting at certain hours. Kind of a "weekly sleep quota at X PM". For example: I need to be asleep at 14:00 at least once a week to work well
