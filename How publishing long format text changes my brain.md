# Introduction
When I publish something, it's a explicit declaration for myself and for the world that there were enough changes for me to actually upload a new version.

# Publishing vs Writing for myself
## Why even bother? What's the difference?
When I publish something to a public space, like I'm doing here with GitHub, my brain changes modes. It pays more attention to certain things, and less to others.

This doesn't mean that I should only create things for publishing purposes: as with many things in life, there are advantages and disadvantages both for writing something that I know only I will read or something that maybe other people will read.

## About the exposition
I don't actually there will be a great public to my ideas, that's not the intention. Otherwise I would publish in a more accessible platform than GitHub.
However, it's not exactly about the "I know people will read this" feeling that I'm looking for writing this. It's the "Anyone can read this at any time" feeling that I'm looking for.
All of this is making a public statement: "This is me, and this is how I think"

# The illiteracy of depth
## The difference between add a lot of small parts and a single small part
Starting with an analogy: if someone can pick a full water bottle and lift it 100 times, it won't be nothing in special, it will be just stupid and time consuming. Now, if someone can lift, a single time, a 50kg load, that's someone strong. In total, the work is the same: 100 * 500g = 50kg, but we know that it's a very different thing happening in both situations.
## When you are consuming
One of today's problems is about the lack of depth in content.
There's difference between variety and depth. Someone can even explore
### About "Easy to digest content"
When I'm taking the first steps into something, it's usually helpful to start with an easier version of it. For example, summaries. The problem is that I don't move past this phase. I am eternally stuck as a beginner in everything.
## "Too Long; Didn't Read"
One of the things I actually noticing while writing all this is that my brain is at unease: it's saying to me: "this thing is too long"; "there's too much text in the screen"

## TED Talks

## When you are creating
One of the proposals of this work itself, is to propel myself to learn how to write a long-format anything. I actually write a lot but, like said in the previous section, I write a great variety only in a surface level.

# Common traps about reading over and over the same content
Even while writing this, it start's to get weird writing because you kind of have read what you wrote before, to not get in the same trap explained in [[#The difference between add a lot of small parts and a single small part]], but at the same time it get's so repetitive reading again and again the same sentence that my brain shuts off.

# LLM can show us how we think
A great way of understanding how ourselves think is to look at how some reasoning models of Large Language Models (LLM) themselves think. Before, in the section about [[#The illiteracy of depth]], I talk about how today's content is produced in a way that doesn't enter the nuances of a topic. And that fault transfer's to our logic. This can be well seem in the video [[r0 Video WHY R1 & o1 Models Underthink Complex Reasoning (+ Solution)]], from [[r0 Discover AI (Youtube channel)]].

# Practices while I'm writing and reading
## Studying my own text
Spaced repetition

## Writing my own text
How much to repeat of what I said before? A strategy to guarantee that I'm not just spitting out unrelated information about the same topic

## To add in the future
- This idea partially comes from the book "Building a Second Brain", from Thiago Forte. When he talks about "CODE", being the "E" "Externalize" or something like that.
- Spaced repetition in writing long texts
- How commit and push github functions make a immutable yet reparable modification
