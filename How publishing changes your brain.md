# Introduction
When you publish something, it's a explicit declaration for yourself and for the world that there were enough changes for you to actually upload a new version.

# Why even bother? What's the difference?
When you publish something to a public space, like I'm doing here with GitHub, the brain changes modes. It pays more attention to certain things, and less to others.

This doesn't mean that you should only create things for publishing purposes: as with many things in life, there are advantages and disadvantages both for writing something that you know only you will read or something that maybe other people will read.

# About the exposition
I don't actually there will be a great public to my ideas, that's not the intention for now anyway. Otherwise I would publish in a more accessible platform than GitHub.
However, it's not exactly about the "I know people will read this" feeling that I'm looking for writing this. It's the "Anyone can read this at any time" feeling that I'm looking for.

# To add in the future
- This idea partially comes from the book "Building a Second Brain", from Thiago Forte. When he talks about "CODE", being the "E" "Externalize" or something like that.
