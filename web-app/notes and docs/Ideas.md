## List
- Filters
- Time slider (In a way that I can see the table as if I were 10 days on the past, 12 days, etc), so I can get a better grasp of my progress
- User preferences (autoSaveEnabled, displayOptions, etc)
- Log of questions attempted
- PMG-X probability distribution: what PMG-X I have a chance of k% of improving my LaMI?
- When my yesterday's attempt was with help, it's probably a good idea to try it again today
- Questions that I attempted yesterday and could only do with help are of the utmost priority
- There are some questions that are pre-requisite to others. Make something to let this be clear, so I don't try to do something before the pre-requisite also being done that day?
- Column of question in latex and llm output. Repeatable adn beautiful
- Obsidian vault data scraper to use with LLM
- Create column in the .csv to implement MIG data selection ([[r0 Video Introduction of MIG]])
